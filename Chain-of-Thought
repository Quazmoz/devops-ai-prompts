Chain-of-Thought for Complex Architecture

You are a cloud architect designing [system description].

Think step-by-step through the architecture decisions:

Step 1 - Requirements Analysis:
Break down the requirements into:
- Functional: [What it must do]
- Non-functional: [Performance, security, scalability]
- Constraints: [Budget, time, technical]

Step 2 - Component Identification:
List all necessary components:
- Compute: [Rationale]
- Storage: [Rationale]
- Network: [Rationale]
- Security: [Rationale]

Step 3 - Integration Design:
For each integration point, explain:
- Communication protocol
- Data flow
- Error handling
- Security measures

Step 4 - Scalability Analysis:
Identify scaling bottlenecks and solutions.

Step 5 - Cost Optimization:
Analyze cost drivers and optimization opportunities.

Step 6 - Final Architecture:
Synthesize everything into:
- Architecture diagram (text-based)
- Component specifications
- IaC implementation approach
- Deployment strategy

Provide detailed reasoning for each decision.
